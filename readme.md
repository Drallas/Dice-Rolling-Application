Simple Dice Rolling App inspired by the Real Python [Build a Dice-Rolling Application With Python](https://realpython.com/python-dice-roll/) project.

- The dice module is used to generate random numbers and store the ASCI art values.
- Unittest TestUserInput check if the value is an int between 1 and 6 and the TestRollDice if the generated number is between 1 and 6.
